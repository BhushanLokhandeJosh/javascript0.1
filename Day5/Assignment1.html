        //Q. What is the difference between ++i and i++?

        let number = 10;

        let postIncr = number++;

        console.log(postIncr);//10

        let preIncr = ++number;

        console.log(preIncr);//12


        /* CONCLUSION :
        
        1. Only difference between preincrement and postincrement is the 
        order of operations between the increment of the variable and 
        the value the operator returns. 

        2.PreIncrement 
        This will first increment value by 1 then return it to variable.

        3.PostIncrement
        This will return the value before it is increment by 1.
