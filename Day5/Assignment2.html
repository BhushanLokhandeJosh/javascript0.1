        /* Q. What do you think would happen if you pass an index beyond the 
       range of the string? Or if you pass a negative index? Try it out. */

        let str = "Bhushan";

        for(let i=0;i<=str.length;i++){

        console.log(str.charAt(i));

        }

        console.log(str.charAt(-10));


        /* CONCLUSION :

        1.If the value of index is negative then it tries to access the location 
        which is not allocated to the String which is similar to accessing
        an index greater than the size of the String for such case it will 
        give undefined as result.
