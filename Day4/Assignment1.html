        /* QUESTIONS : 
        1. Do statements after the loop run? 
        No, Return just jumps back directly to the function call returning 
        the value and everything in function after return statement is ignored.
        
        2. What is the return value? 
        Return value will be result of statements in matched case conditions.
        
        3. Can we pass a return value from within a loop? 
        Yes,We can pass return value from within a loop.
        
        4. Can you return from inside an if block? 
        Yes,We can also return from inside an if block.
        .
        
        5. What impact does that have? 
        Return statement can act as a break statement for functions and no 
        further break statement is required and while In case of Break 
        statement,It will break from current loop and executes statements 
        outside of current loop.
