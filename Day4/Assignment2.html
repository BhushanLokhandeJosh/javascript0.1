        /* Take a function that accepts a function as a parameter 
        (also known as callback function). 

        function test(callback){
            callback();
        }

        Explore the following cases - what is printed in the console, 
        and what gets returned:

        test(callbackFunc)

        test(callbackFunc())

        test(() => callbackFunc())
        
        */

        function test(callback){

        }

        function callbackFunc(){
            console.log("Calling the callback function...");
            return 5;
        }

        //Executed successfully.
        test(() => callbackFunc());
        

        //Executed successfully.
        test(callbackFunc);


        //Not executed.Uncaught TypeError: callback is not a function.
       // test(callbackFunc());


        function check(callback){
            return callback();
        }

        console.log(check(callbackFunc));

        /*

        1. What happens when you return callback from the check function?
        
        Reference / pointer to function is been passed to check function and
        in check function we are returning callback function by executing it.
        */

        console.log(check(callbackFunc()));

        /* 

        2. What happens when you return callback() from the check function?
        
        //Uncaught TypeError: callback is not a function
        In this case,callback function is executed and its result has been
        passed to check function and thus it will not execute as no such
        function exists there. */
