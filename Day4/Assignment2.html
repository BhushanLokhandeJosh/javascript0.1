        /* Take a function that accepts a function as a parameter 
        (also known as callback function). 

        function test(callback){
            callback();
        }
        function callbackFunc(){
        console.log(“Calling the callback function”)
        return 5;
        } 
    
        Explore the following cases - what is printed in the console, 
        and what gets returned:

        test(callbackFunc)

        test(callbackFunc())

        test(() => callbackFunc())
        
        */

        function test(callback){
            console.log(callback());
        }

        function callbackFunc(){
            console.log("Calling the callback function...");
            return "Hello";
        }

        //Executed successfully.
        test(() => callbackFunc());
        

        //Executed successfully.
        test(callbackFunc);


        //Not executed.Uncaught TypeError: callback is not a function.
        test(callbackFunc());

        /* 
        1. What happens when you return callback() from the test function?
        In this case,callback function is executed and its result has been
        passed to test function and thus it will not execute.

        2. What happens when you return callback from the test function?
        In this case,callback function reference is been passed to test 
        function and thus it calls function callbackFunc() from reference 
        passed.
